# my-awesome-project

This project is to understand how git and github work, but it's off to a reaaaally bad start. 

Achievements: I managed to pull the project so yay to that, but not sure I actually understand how all this shit works. Crying inside, wish me luck. 
J'ai réussi à faire clone, pull et je m'apprête à faire push.
